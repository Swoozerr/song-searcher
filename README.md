# Song Searcher project for CS400 of UW-Madison.
This project takes in a kaggle set of the top songs from spotify from 2010-2019 ([here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/leonardopena/top-spotify-songs-from-20102019-by-year)) as a csv file. Each song is extracted and placed in a Song object. These Song objects are then placed in a Red-Black Tree data structure for ease of data lookup.


## To run this project, follow these steps:
1. Download and open the project folder in an IDE. I recommend using IntelliJ or Eclipse.
2. Run the Main.java file and follow the steps within the terminal.
